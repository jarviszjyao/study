SSL Certificate Management Evolution: Automating Visibility Across 50+ AWS Accounts​
By Channels Cloud Enablement & Operations Team

​Team Context​
As the Channels Cloud Enablement and Operations team, we maintain AWS environments for MyWorkspace, an internal platform serving employees globally. While migrating from on-premises infrastructure to AWS streamlined application deployment and scalability, operational excellence demands rigorous attention to security and compliance—particularly for SSL certificate lifecycle management.

​Incident Retrospective: The Catalyst for Change​
A late-night outage in the UK MyWorkspace service exposed critical gaps in our certificate governance. A Venafi-issued certificate was inadvertently revoked via a ServiceNow request after an engineer, lacking visibility into its active deployment on an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB), mistakenly classified it as obsolete. This incident underscored two systemic risks:

​Zero Deployment Visibility: With 110+ certificates across 50+ AWS accounts in 30+ markets, manually tracking where certificates were deployed became untenable.
​Fragmented Renewal Processes: Reliance on Venafi expiration alerts left us vulnerable to human error during manual renewal workflows.
​Solution Architecture: Building Certificate Transparency​

​1. Cross-Account Certificate Discovery Engine​
To eliminate blind spots, we engineered an automated tracking system:

​AWS Account Inventory: Aggregated all accounts via Cloudability’s API.
​Lambda-Powered Scanning: Deployed read-only Lambda functions to scan AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) across all accounts during off-peak hours, extracting certificate metadata (ARN, expiration dates, serial numbers).
​Venafi-ACM Reconciliation: Matched ACM certificates against Venafi’s CMDB via serial number hashing, flagging discrepancies (e.g., revoked-but-deployed certificates).
​2. Proactive Compliance Automation​

​JIRA Integration: Auto-generated tickets 90 days pre-expiration, assigned to engineers with contextual data (associated ALB, Route53 records).
​Visualization Dashboard: Built an interactive UI color-coding certificates by expiration urgency (30/60/90 days), enabling drill-down to deployment details.
​3. Guardrails Against Human Error​

​Real-Time Validation: Any Venafi status change (e.g., revocation) triggers instant cross-checks against ACM deployment states.
​Least-Privilege Execution: Scanners operate with minimal read-only permissions, isolated per AWS account.
​Outcomes and Metrics​

​23 Ghost Certificates Retired: Identified obsolete certificates still active in production.
​100% Prevention of Misaligned Revocations: Blocked 12+ high-risk manual operations via automated validation.
​60% Reduction in Renewal Overhead: Streamlined ticket assignment and context handoff.
​Future Roadmap: Toward Zero-Touch Renewals​
While DIGS Zero Touch’s certificate auto-renewal lacks AWS integration today, we’re prototyping:

​ALB Listener Drift Detection: Using AWS Config to monitor certificate updates and auto-reload listeners.
​Canary Deployment Pipelines: Testing phased certificate rollouts with automated rollback triggers.
​Operational Philosophy​
Cloud-native resilience starts with observable trust chains. By transforming certificates from invisible liabilities into auditable assets, we’ve turned a reactive scramble into proactive engineering—where every SSL handshake tells a story of automated governance.

Lessons from the midnight outage now echo in every automated validation check: In the cloud, visibility isn’t just power—it’s continuity.
